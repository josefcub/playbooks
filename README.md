# Personal Playbooks

Uploading here as I work through and learn Ansible and the right way to automate things like VM provisioning.  Caveat emptor, YMMV, etc, et al, ad nauseum.  This likely will not work for you.

  * -provision-: Provision a CentOS 7 libvirt/qemu guest based on the minimal install CD.  Also configures snmpd for my portable lab, and adds it to the lab's monitoring service.
