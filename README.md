# Personal Playbooks

Uploading here as I work through and learn Ansible and the right way to automate things like VM provisioning.  Caveat emptor, YMMV, etc, et al, ad nauseum.  This likely will not work for you.

  * provision: Provision a CentOS 7 libvirt/qemu guest based on the minimal install CD, on my personal and portable lab.  Also configures snmpd for my lab, and adds it to the local monitoring service.
